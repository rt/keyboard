# plates

tactile/clicky switches reportedly feel better in a plate with give like poly
or carbon or aluminium, for linears steel or brass. for sound, clicky switches
sound slightly bassier on brass, higher pitched on aluminium, slightly muted on
poly carb.

pla didn't feel good with anything.

Would like to get a polycarb plate cut but can't find a vendor ...

**stiffness**

Stiffness is increased with thickness by cube 
- 3mm plates 2x2x2 = 8 times stiffer than 1.5mm plates
- 2mm plates 1.5x1.5x1.5 = 3.375 times stiffer than 1.5mm plates

- Aluminum (69)
- Brass (100-125)
- Copper (117)
- Titanium (110.3)
- PolyCarbonate (2-2.4)
- Acrylic (3.2) > (3mm, 8x3.2=25.6)
- POM, Polyoxymethylene (3.15) > (2mm, 3.375x3.15=10.63) (3mm, 8x3.15=25.2)
- Carbon fibre reinforced plastic (30-50)

**clicky**

Generally feel like there is a mushy feel when on soft boards

POM: heavier whites, not great felt kinda heavy
Aluminum: feels like hitting a bag of wet sand 
Brass: nice, might still be harsh for linears
Copper: same feel as brass

**tactile**

Generally feel good on both soft and hard.
POM:
Aluminum: Zeal (62g) sometimes feels good, sometimes feels like wet sand.
Brass: Holy Pandas feel and sound great. Zilents (55g) feels pretty good but a harder plate seemed better, due to not much sound maybe steel plates would even be good.
Copper: Zilents (55g) has a nice feel and cushion due to the silencing with a firm base. Feel like the nice sound of the plate is wasted though. Zeals (62g) feel nice, better than the Aluminum because the plates stiffness but do not have much sound difference, maybe slightly better than Aluminum.

**linear**

Generally feel that soft boards would be better given the bottoming out. Reds are probably too light.
POM: Reds feel pretty nice, might be too light because hands do get tired (probably even harsher on firm boards)
Aluminum: 
Brass: 
Copper:
