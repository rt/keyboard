# switches

I think I like linear or mild tactile now.

Harch tactile feels like your fingers lose control.

However, linear bottom out is harsh on the hands and silent switches' softness might be good.

**current**

Zilents 67g spring swapped to 55g lubed: possibly better on polycarb plate
Tealios 67g lubed: possibly better with lighter spring and silent/soft
Holy Pandas lubed: possibly better with lighter spring
Zelios 62g lubed: too harsh of a drop off
Zelios V1 67g lubed: too loose/rattle, there is a new V1 coming out
Zelios V1 78g lubed: too loose/rattle, kinda a nice weight, there is a new V1 coming out
Gateron Yellow: haven't felt the greatness everyone talks about yet.
Gateron Red: maybe too light?

*Want to try:*

- Sakurio (silent linear low spring weight): this would test the linear with silent softness
- Zelios V1 upgraded: this would check if less harsh tactile is viable
- Lighter spring for Holy Pandas?

**profiles**

GMK: Abs is great (apparently it might not be so for even SA abs)

MT3: Don't like on mrkabuda, too harsh and lips too rigid. But, Like them on dactyl manuform, they seem to hug my fingers better. Even less finger travel.

MDA: Flat sometimes feels good on both dactyl manuform and mrkabuda but in general too slippery.

**history**

*clicky ng*

white 50 60g: too light most of the time (mushy)
pink 55 65g: feels like there is too much friction
pale blues 60 80g : too heavy

Note: swapping white and pink springs might work for both (especially white)
