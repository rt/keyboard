# layers etc

For IDEs like IntelliJ and Visual Studio you need to make custom maps where defaults aren't available.

### Shared concepts (vim)

While each IDE layer can have the conceptual key binding sometime it's the same with the vim plugin.

In general, it's easier to remember with always using the layer trigger key (even if it is the same vim macro)

Thus, never use the vim layer when in IDEs.

**works as is**

- vim basics (duh, that what the plugin is for)
- macros
- marks?
- folding

**specials**

*Visual Studio: Map View Navigation to the same as Vim*

- View: Navigate to View on Left > ctl-m
- View: Navigate to View on Down > ctl-n
- View: Navigate to View on Up > ctl-e
- View: Navigate to View on Right > ctl-i
